of development.

Origin of name
--------------
**Bled Island** is an island at the center of lake *Bled* in the Julian Alps of the Upper Carniolan region 
of northwestern Slovenia, where it adjoins the town of *Bled*.

<small>They do not bother with naming, and so I am. Just used the abbreviation 
BLok EDitor as name.</small>
